## Introduction and Significance 

Our project is an analysis of educational inequalities in America. Educational inequality can be defined as the unequal distribution of academic resources, including school funding, experienced teachers, textbooks, and technology1 . We will focus on the education system in California because UCLA researchers found that California is the one of the most segregated states, in regards to education2.

In our primary data visualization, we made an interactive map, with the division of counties, showing the achievement gap between White and Latinx students. Darker regions indicate a larger achievement gap, whereas lighter regions show a smaller achievement gap. (let’s add a legend showing what each color indicates. To better understand why achievement gaps exist, in our more analysis we will observe how funding and a factor from a student’s placement on the Education Equality Index3 may impact their abilities to attain a good education. Additionally, we have a graphic comparing the admission rates of Latinx students over the years, in addition to other ethnicity.

## Mean Amount of Students Receiving Free or Reduced Meals (by county)

To further demonstrate the existence of education inequalities in California, we mapped the mean amount of students in 2016-17 that received free or reduced meals in each county. According to a 2021 research, receiving a reduced-price lunch in schools in California requires “an annual income of less than $48,000”, of which “59 percent of schoolchildren” 1 qualify under these standards. Whether students receive this resource is an important factor to study when assessing achievement rates and gaps because it’s an indication that those students are living at or below the poverty level, which helps us to comprehend why we may see larger achievement gaps in certain regions2. The deeper the color, the more students receive free or reduced meals. Though the number of students recorded doesn’t directly reflect the inequality among White and Latinx students, there is likely an association between the counties with a deeper color (which show larger rates of students receiving free meals and living at/below poverty), and their likelihood of experiencing more educational barriers in their current and higher education. To demonstrate such correlation, we continued to explore the data regarding both education and ethnicity through the remaining two graphs.

## Current Expenditures for Public Schools in California (in each county, per dollars)

To further analyze the relationship between geographical factors and existing education inequality, we selected five counties with the most and least free or reduced meals and compared them on different scales due to the gaps in number. Because Viz 2 shades regions according to the number of students on this meal plan, we were curious to assess the correlation between this factor and state funding per county 3, evaluating whether unequal distributions existed. We recognize that school funding may differ due to population size in counties, but our focus here is to compare how school funding is associated with the mean amount of students receiving free or reduced meals. In addition, we will identify if regions with more students living at or below the poverty level are receiving more funding, which we would presume is the desire because those are the counties that need to provide more support for their student population.

## University of California Admission Rates by Racial and Ethnic Populations (2010-2020)

Finally, to demonstrate the educational inequality with an analysis of the differences among ethnic groups, we relied on the college admission data as a standard to measure a particular group’s accessibility to better education resources. Here, for example, we made a line chart showing the first-year admitted students in University of California (UC)4, the largest public university system in the US, from 2010-2020, particularly focusing on three major ethnic groups: Asian, Latinx, and White. What first stood out to us in the graph is the change of numbers for White and Latino. By 2010, while white was one dominant ethnic group among the admitted students, Latinos were about 25% less. Nevertheless, as time passed and the admission committee paid more attention to the diversity of student groups, we see a significant rise in the number of Latino students, which could be interpreted as an act in reducing the previous education inequality existing in California.
