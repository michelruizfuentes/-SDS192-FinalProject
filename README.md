## Introduction

Our project is an analysis of educational inequalities in America. Educational inequality can be defined as the unequal distribution of academic resources, including school funding, experienced teachers, textbooks, and technology1 . We will focus on the education system in California because UCLA researchers found that California is the one of the most segregated states, in regards to education2.

In our primary data visualization, we made an interactive map, with the division of counties, showing the achievement gap between White and Latinx students. Darker regions indicate a larger achievement gap, whereas lighter regions show a smaller achievement gap. (let’s add a legend showing what each color indicates. To better understand why achievement gaps exist, in our more analysis we will observe how funding and a factor from a student’s placement on the Education Equality Index3 may impact their abilities to attain a good education. Additionally, we have a graphic comparing the admission rates of Latinx students over the years, in addition to other ethnicity.
